In all programming languages, you have data types such as `int`, `string` and `float`. In Lean, these exist as well, but you can (and will in this course) define own data types. In all cases, we write `x : α` for a term `x` of type `α`, so we write `False : Bool`, `42 : ℕ`, but also `f : ℕ → ℝ` (for a function from ℕ to ℝ, which is an own type) and `0 ≠ 1 : Prop` (the proposition that 0 and 1 are different natural numbers), which is a proposition. Terms and types can depend on variables, e.g. in `∀ (n : ℕ), n < n + 1 : Prop` (the term `n < n + 1` depends on `n : ℕ`) and `f : (n : ℕ) → (Fin n → ℝ)` where `Fin n` is the type which carries `{0, ..., n-1}` (here, the type `Fin n → ℝ` depends on `n : ℕ`), which is a function `f` with domain `ℕ` such that `f n ∈ ℝ^n`.

Two words for terms recur throughout, depending on their type: a term `h : P` whose type `P` is a `Prop` is called a *proof* (of `P`), while a term `a : α` whose type `α` is a `Type u` is called *data*. So `42 : ℕ` and `true : Bool` are data, whereas any term of the proposition `0 ≠ 1` is a proof of it. (The two kinds of universe, `Prop` and `Type u`, are the subject of the next section.)

As we see, these new data types are more abstract in the sense that Lean understands `ℕ` (and `ℝ`) as infinite types, which are not limited by floating point arithmetic. E.g., `ℕ` actually represents an infinite set that is characterized by containing `0`, and if it contains `n`, then it also contains the successor of `n` (represented by `succ n`). (Frequently, this construction is attributed to Giuseppe Peano.) Accordingly, the real numbers are defined by an equivalence relation on Cauchy sequences, which is quite elaborate.

In Lean, all objects are terms, and every term needs a type. Interestingly, since a type is also some term in the language, it needs a type as well. This leads to a hierarchy of these types.

# The universe hierarchy
%%%
tag := "type-universes"
%%%

Every term has a type; but a type is itself a term of some type. To keep the system consistent, these type-of-a-type (also called universes) are organized into a countably infinite hierarchy.

At the bottom sit the two universes you meet first (Here, the `#check` command gives the type of a term):

```lean
#check (42 : ℕ)         -- a term ...
#check (ℕ : Type)       -- ... whose type ℕ lives in `Type`
#check ((2 = 2) : Prop) -- a proposition ...
#check (Prop : Type)    -- ... and `Prop` itself lives in `Type`
```

`Type` (which is the same as `Type 0`) is the universe of ordinary data types (`ℕ`, `ℝ`, `Bool`, `List α`, ...), and `Prop` (which is the universe of *propositions*, i.e. True/False-statements). But `Type` cannot contain itself -- that would be paradoxical -- so `Type` in turn lives in a larger universe `Type 1`, which lives in `Type 2`, and so on without end:

```lean
#check (Type : Type 1)      -- Type   : Type 1
#check (Type 1 : Type 2)    -- Type 1 : Type 2
```

:::example "The connection of `Type` to `Sort`"

The whole tower is captured by a single keyword `Sort`:

* `Sort 0` is `Prop`;
* `Sort 1` is `Type 0`, i.e. `Type`;
* `Sort (u+1)` is `Type u`.

```lean
example : Sort 0 = Prop := rfl
example : Sort 1 = Type := rfl
example : Type = Type 0 := rfl
```

So `Sort` is the umbrella that unifies `Prop` and all the `Type u`, and the one rule governing the hierarchy is `Sort u : Sort (u+1)`. There is deliberately no `Type : Type`; *why* this restriction is needed -- it blocks a type-theoretic version of Russell's paradox -- is taken up in the {ref "universe-hierarchy"}[Mathematics part].
:::

*Why `Prop` is special.*
Of particular interest is the type `Prop`, which consists of statements that can be `True` or `False`. It includes mathematical statements, so either the hypotheses, or the goal of what is to be proven. A hypothesis in Lean has the form `hP : P`, which means `P` is true, and this statement is called `hP`. Synonomously, it means that `P` is true and `hP` is a proof of `P`. The hypotheses here have names `P Q R S`, and the proofs of the hypotheses `hP hQ hR hS`. All names can be arbitrary. Furthermore, there are hypotheses of the form `P → Q`, which is the statement that `P` implies `Q`. (Note the similarity to function notation as in `f : ℝ → ℝ`.)

We note three specifics which only apply to `Prop`:

*Proof irrelevance*: Note that `Prop` only records *that* a statement holds, but not *which* proof we chose. This is *proof irrelevance*, which means the following goal closes by `rfl`:

```lean
example (P : Prop) (h₁ h₂ : P) : h₁ = h₂ := rfl
```

For data living in a `Type` there is no such collapse, for obvious reasons. (The red squiggly line indicates an error, i.e. a proof which does not work.)

```lean +error
example (a b : ℕ) : a = b := rfl
```
See also {ref "prop-vs-type"}[Prop vs Type].

*`Prop` is impredicative*: As long as the body of a `∀` statement is a proposition, the whole `∀` is a `Prop` -- even when we range over an arbitrarily large universe of types:

```lean
-- Prop-valued body: stays `Prop`, however big the domain.
#check (∀ α : Type, α = α)     -- Prop
#check (∀ α : Type 5, α = α)   -- Prop
```

No `Type u` behaves this way. Replace the proposition `α = α` by `α → α`, and the universe of the `∀` is forced to grow with the domain, exactly as predicativity demands:

```lean
-- Type-valued body: the universe grows with the domain.
#check (∀ α : Type, α → α)     -- Type 1
#check (∀ α : Type 5, α → α)   -- Type 6
```

So the two syntactically parallel statements `∀ α : Type 5, α = α` and `∀ α : Type 5, α → α` land in wildly different places -- `Prop` versus `Type 6` -- purely because the first has a `Prop` body and the second a `Type` body. This asymmetry (a `∀` into `Prop` stays small; a `∀` into `Type u` must climb) is exactly what it means to say *`Prop` is impredicative and the `Type u` are predicative*.

(A definition can be made to work at *any* universe level at once; that uses `def`, so we defer it to the {ref "polymorphic-functions"}[chapter on functions].)

*Restricted (subsingleton) elimination*: A proof carries no observable content, so Lean forbids *reading data off a proof* by case analysis -- otherwise a value could depend on *which* proof we had, which proof irrelevance declares meaningless. Eliminating a proposition may therefore, in general, only produce further propositions, not data. Deciding as a `Bool` which side of a disjunction holds is rejected:

```lean +error
example (a b : Prop) (h : a ∨ b) : Bool :=
  match h with
  | Or.inl _ => true
  | Or.inr _ => false
```

The error is telling: `recursor 'Or.casesOn' can only eliminate into 'Prop'`. The one exception is *subsingleton elimination*: a proposition with *at most one constructor*, all of whose fields are *themselves proofs*, provably has at most one inhabitant -- so eliminating it can reveal nothing, and Lean does allow it into *any* type. This covers `False` (no constructors, which is exactly why `False.elim` closes *any* goal), `Eq` (which is why we may `rw` even inside data-carrying goals), and `And` (both fields are proofs); but not `Or` (two constructors) nor `∃` (its first field is a genuine witness, not a proof). None of this restriction applies to `Type`: an inductive type in `Type` always eliminates into anything.

Why must it be this way? It is not bureaucracy -- consistency forces it, and for `Or` the argument is a little gem. What cannot escape here is not a *witness* (as it would be for `∃`) but the *tag*: the information *which* of the two branches holds. Take a true `a` and look at the proposition `a ∨ a`. Its two opposite injections are definitionally equal, by proof irrelevance:

```lean
example {a : Prop} (h : a) :
    (Or.inl h : a ∨ a) = Or.inr h := rfl
```

"Left or right?" is simply not a well-posed question about a proof of `a ∨ a` -- the tag does not exist as distinguishable content. So had the rejected `(a ∨ b) → Bool` above been allowed, then with `b := a` it would give `which (Or.inl h) = true` and `which (Or.inr h) = false`; but `Or.inl h ≡ Or.inr h`, so `true ≡ false` -- a contradiction. The indistinguishability of proofs forces the tag to stay trapped, exactly as it would have forced `3 ≡ 5` for a leaked `∃`-witness.

The escape mirrors the one for `∃`, one level up. The data-carrying counterpart of `a ∨ ¬a` is `Decidable a`, which -- crucially -- lives in `Type`, not `Prop`:

```
inductive Decidable (p : Prop) : Type where
  | isFalse (h : ¬p)
  | isTrue  (h :  p)
```

Because `Decidable p` is in `Type`, it *may* eliminate into `Type` -- which is exactly why `if h : p then _ else _` and `decide` compute. The two stories line up exactly:

:::table (align := left) +header
* + Proposition (in `Prop`)
  + Data version (in `Type`)
  + what stays hidden
* + `∃ x, q x`
  + `Σ x, q x`
  + the *witness*
* + `a ∨ ¬a`
  + `Decidable a`
  + the *tag* (which side)
:::

And the classical route mirrors `Classical.choose` precisely: `Classical.em : a ∨ ¬a` is always available (a `Prop`), but its data-carrying counterpart `Classical.propDecidable : Decidable a` goes through `Classical.choice` and is therefore `noncomputable`. The two halves -- `∃`/`Σ`/`choose` about the *witness*, `∨`/`Decidable`/`em` about the *tag* -- are one and the same story: computationally relevant information can leave the `Prop` world only if you place it in `Type` from the start, or pay for it noncomputably with the axiom of choice. (The `Nonempty`/`Classical.choice` version of this is taken up in the {ref "curry-howard"}[chapter on propositions and proofs].)

## How the universe of a type is determined
%%%
tag := "universe-determined"
%%%

You rarely write universe levels by hand -- Lean computes the universe of a compound type from the universes of its parts. A function type `α → β` lands in the *larger* of the two universes involved:

```lean
#check (ℕ → ℕ)        -- Type
#check (ℕ → Type)     -- Type 1  (because `Type : Type 1`)
```

# Inductive types
%%%
tag := "inductive"
%%%

Many everyday types in Lean -- `Nat`, `List`, `Option`, `Bool`, even `Empty` -- are *inductive* types. You declare one by giving a name, the type's universe, and a list of *constructors*: each constructor says how to build a new element of the type out of existing pieces.

The classical example is the natural numbers:

```lean
inductive MyNat where
  | zero : MyNat
  | succ (n : MyNat) : MyNat
```

This declaration introduces three things at once:

- a new type `MyNat`;
- two constructors `MyNat.zero` and `MyNat.succ`, so every element of `MyNat` is either `zero` or `succ n` for some `n`;
- a *recursor* `MyNat.rec` which lets you define functions on `MyNat` by specifying what happens in each constructor case.

The declaration only *forms the type*. How to actually build its elements and *define functions* on it -- typically by pattern matching on the constructors -- is the subject of {ref "terms"}[the next chapter], on constructing terms.

Proofs about an inductive type use the `induction` tactic, which applies the recursor for you: one subgoal per constructor, with an induction hypothesis for each recursive argument.

Inductive types also cover non-recursive data:

```lean
inductive Colour where
  | red | green | blue
```

and parameterized types:

```lean
-- `MyOption α` is either `none` or `some a` for some `a : α`.
inductive MyOption (α : Type) where
  | none : MyOption α
  | some (a : α) : MyOption α
```

Inductive types are the main mechanism by which new data types enter Lean; `Mathlib` uses them extensively, and understanding them is essential for reading the library. This also answers the question of the previous section from the other side: the universe of an inductive type must be large enough to hold all of its constructor arguments.

# Structures
%%%
tag := "structures"
%%%

While inductive types let us define types with multiple constructors, many mathematical objects are better described as a *collection of named fields*. For example, a point in the plane has an `x`-coordinate and a `y`-coordinate. In Lean, we use `structure` for this.

A `structure` is a special case of an inductive type with exactly one constructor and named fields. Here is a simple example:

```lean
structure Point where
  x : ℕ
  y : ℕ
```

This declares a new type `Point` whose elements are records with two `ℕ` fields. (Both must be given in order to define a `Point`, which is the only way we can make such a Point, i.e. it only has a single constructor.) Like every declaration, it produces more than the type alone: a constructor `Point.mk` and one projection per field. We can inspect their types without building any value yet:

```lean
#check (Point.mk : ℕ → ℕ → Point)
#check (Point.x : Point → ℕ)
#check (Point.y : Point → ℕ)
```

Fields may be given *default values* as part of the declaration:

```lean
structure MyConfig where
  width : ℕ := 80
  height : ℕ := 24
  title : String := "Untitled"
```

These defaults are used whenever a value is built without specifying every field.

One structure can *extend* another, inheriting all of its fields:

```lean
structure Point3D extends Point where
  z : ℕ
```

so a `Point3D` has fields `x`, `y` (from `Point`) and `z`. This is particularly important in Mathlib, where the algebraic hierarchy uses structure extension extensively: `CommRing` extends `Ring`, which extends `Semiring`, and so on.

Structures are natural for representing mathematical objects. A *Gaussian integer* (a complex number with integer parts) is a pair of `ℤ`s,

```lean
structure MyComplex where
  re : ℤ
  im : ℤ
```

and a structure may bundle *data together with a property* -- here a linear map, carrying both a function and a proof that it respects addition:

```lean
structure MyLinearMap (α β : Type) [Add α] [Add β] where
  toFun : α → β
  map_add : ∀ x y : α, toFun (x + y) = toFun x + toFun y
```

This pattern of bundling data with properties is fundamental to how Mathlib organizes mathematics.

How to *construct* values of these types, read their fields, and define operations on them is the subject of {ref "terms"}[the next chapter].

# Inductive types vs structures
%%%
tag := "inductive-vs-structure"
%%%

When should you use `inductive` and when `structure`?

* Use `structure` when your type has a single constructor with named fields. Examples: points, complex numbers, algebraic structures.
* Use `inductive` when your type has multiple constructors. Examples: natural numbers, lists, trees, `Option`, `Bool`.

A `structure` is syntactic sugar for an inductive type with one constructor. The definition

```
structure Point where
  x : ℕ
  y : ℕ
```

is essentially equivalent to

```
inductive Point where
  | mk : ℕ → ℕ → Point
```

but the `structure` version gives us named fields, {ref "structure-values"}[dot notation], the possibility for default values, and the `extends` mechanism. (A `class` is in turn a `structure` marked for use by instance search; we return to it in the {ref "typeclasses"}[Typeclass] chapter.)
