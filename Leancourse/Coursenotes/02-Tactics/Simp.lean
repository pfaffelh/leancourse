tag := "simp"

**Summary:** In `mathlib` there are many lemmas with `=` or `â†”` statements that can be applied with `rw` and are marked with `@[simp]`. These marked lemmas have the property that the right side is a simplified form of the left side. With `simp`, `lean` looks for matching lemmas and tries to apply them.

**Examples**

:::table (align := left) (header := true)
* + Proof state
  + Tactic
  + New proof state
* + âŠ¢ n + 0 = n
  + simp
  + **no goals** ðŸŽ‰
* + h : n + 0 = m {br}[] âŠ¢ P
  + simp at h
  + h : n = m {br}[] âŠ¢ P
:::

**Notes:**

If you want to know which lemmas were used, try `simp?`. This provides some clues.

:::table (align := left) (header := true)
* + Proof state
  + Tactic
  + New proof state
* + `âŠ¢ n + 0 = n`
  + `simp?`
  + **no goals** ðŸŽ‰ {br}[] Try this: {br}[]
  `simp only add_zero, eq_self_iff_true`
