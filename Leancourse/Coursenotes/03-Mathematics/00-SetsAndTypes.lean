#doc (Manual) "Sets and Types" =>
%%%
htmlSplit := .never
tag := "sets-and-types"

A mathematician thinks in *sets*; Lean thinks in *types*. This chapter
pins down how the two relate -- how a set is represented, how its
operations unfold to familiar logical connectives, how set equality
works, and how sets, subtypes, and types differ. The other staple that
every later chapter takes for granted -- *propositions* and their
*proofs* -- was covered in {ref "curry-howard"}[the Curry-Howard
chapter] of the {ref "lean"}[Lean part]; from here on we use it freely.

# Sets versus types
%%%
tag := "set-vs-type"
%%%

The first reflex to unlearn is the set-theoretic one that *everything
is a set*. In set theory `∈` is the single primitive, an object can be
a member of many sets, and there is no fixed notion of "the type of
`x`". Type theory inverts this: the primitive is the *type*, and every
term `a : α` has *exactly one* type, fixed once and for all.

So what is a *set* in Lean? It is **not** a new type. A `Set α` is a
*predicate* on the already-existing type `α` -- in fact `Set α` is
*definitionally* `α → Prop` -- that carves out some of `α`'s terms. An
element of `s : Set α` therefore still has type `α`; the set only
records *which* terms of `α` lie in it, and `a ∈ s` is just `s a`.

Three notions are worth keeping firmly apart:

- a *type* `α` -- the ambient collection of terms;
- a *set* `s : Set α` -- a predicate selecting terms of `α`, whose
  elements *keep* their type `α`;
- a *subtype* `{ x : α // p x }` (see {ref "subtypes"}[Subtypes]) -- a
  genuinely *new* type, whose terms are pairs of a value and a proof
  that it satisfies `p`.

So there *is* a difference between a set and a type, and it is the one
a mathematician must internalize. The rest of this chapter makes it
precise: sets as predicates and their operations, when two sets are
equal, and finally how to cross the gap -- turning a set back into a
type.

# Sets are predicates
%%%
tag := "foundations-sets"
%%%

In Mathlib a set over a type `α` has type `Set α`, and `Set α` is
*definitionally* the function type `α → Prop`.  A set is thus nothing
more than a predicate: the term `a : α` belongs to `s : Set α` exactly
when `s a` holds, and `a ∈ s` is notation for precisely that.

```lean
-- `Set α` is definitionally `α → Prop`
#check (Set ℕ)
example : Set ℕ = (ℕ → Prop) := rfl

-- Set-builder notation packages a predicate as a set
def Evens : Set ℕ := { n | n % 2 = 0 }

-- Membership unfolds to applying the predicate
example : (4 ∈ Evens) ↔ (4 % 2 = 0) := Iff.rfl

-- ...so concrete membership questions are decidable
example : 4 ∈ Evens := by
  show 4 % 2 = 0
  decide

example : 3 ∉ Evens := by
  show ¬ (3 % 2 = 0)
  decide
```

Because a set *is* a predicate, two predicates that hold of exactly
the same elements describe the *same* set -- set equality is
*extensional*. We make this precise just below.

# Subset, union, intersection, complement
%%%
tag := "foundations-set-ops"
%%%

The usual Boolean operations on sets are all defined pointwise on the
underlying predicates, so each unfolds to a familiar logical
connective.

```lean
-- `s ⊆ t` means: every member of `s` is a member of `t`
example (s t : Set ℕ) :
    (s ⊆ t) ↔ ∀ a, a ∈ s → a ∈ t := Iff.rfl

-- the empty set, the universal set, and the operations
#check (∅ : Set ℕ)
#check (Set.univ : Set ℕ)
example (s t : Set ℕ) : Set ℕ := s ∩ t   -- intersection
example (s t : Set ℕ) : Set ℕ := s ∪ t   -- union
example (s : Set ℕ)   : Set ℕ := sᶜ      -- complement
```

# Indexed unions and intersections
%%%
tag := "foundations-indexed-ops"
%%%

The binary `∪` and `∩` extend to *arbitrary* families. Given `s : ι → Set α` -- a set `s i` for each index `i : ι` -- the *indexed union* `⋃ i, s i` and *indexed intersection* `⋂ i, s i` collect members across the whole family. As always, membership just unfolds to a quantifier:

```lean
-- `a ∈ ⋃ i, s i` iff `a` lies in *some* member of the family
example (s : ℕ → Set ℕ) (a : ℕ) :
    (a ∈ ⋃ i, s i) ↔ ∃ i, a ∈ s i := Set.mem_iUnion

-- `a ∈ ⋂ i, s i` iff `a` lies in *every* member
example (s : ℕ → Set ℕ) (a : ℕ) :
    (a ∈ ⋂ i, s i) ↔ ∀ i, a ∈ s i := Set.mem_iInter

-- a concrete union: the singletons cover all of `ℕ`
example : (⋃ n : ℕ, {n}) = Set.univ := by
  ext a; simp
```

A common variant restricts the index to a *set* `a : Set ι` rather than the whole index type -- written `⋃ i ∈ a, s i` and `⋂ i ∈ a, s i`. This is just the indexed operation ranging over the members of `a`, and membership carries the bound along:

```lean
-- union over `i` ranging in a set `a`
example (a : Set ℕ) (s : ℕ → Set ℕ) (x : ℕ) :
    (x ∈ ⋃ i ∈ a, s i) ↔ ∃ i ∈ a, x ∈ s i := by
  simp only [Set.mem_iUnion, exists_prop]

-- and the bounded intersection
example (a : Set ℕ) (s : ℕ → Set ℕ) (x : ℕ) :
    (x ∈ ⋂ i ∈ a, s i) ↔ ∀ i ∈ a, x ∈ s i := by
  simp only [Set.mem_iInter]
```

When the family is given not by an index but as a *set of sets* `S : Set (Set α)`, the same operations are written `⋃₀ S` (`sUnion`) and `⋂₀ S` (`sInter`):

```lean
-- `a ∈ ⋃₀ S` iff `a` lies in some `t ∈ S`
example (S : Set (Set ℕ)) (a : ℕ) :
    (a ∈ ⋃₀ S) ↔ ∃ t ∈ S, a ∈ t := Set.mem_sUnion
```

These are exactly the set/indexed suprema and infima of the {ref "complete-lattices"}[complete lattice of sets]: `⋃ i, s i` *is* `iSup s`, and `⋃₀ S` *is* `sSup S`. They are also what {ref "measurable-space"}[σ-algebras] are closed under -- a *countable* union or intersection is just the indexed one over `ι = ℕ`.

# Set equality
%%%
tag := "foundations-set-eq"
%%%

Two sets are equal exactly when they have the same members -- the *set
extensionality* principle `Set.ext`. That this holds at all, and is not
merely a definition, is a real foundational fact: since a set is a
function into `Prop`, it rests on the extensionality axioms taken up in
the next chapter. Here we simply use it.

```lean
-- equality of sets is membership-wise equality
example (s t : Set ℕ) :
    s = t ↔ ∀ a, a ∈ s ↔ a ∈ t :=
  ⟨fun h a => by rw [h], fun h => Set.ext h⟩

-- the `ext` tactic reduces a set equality to membership
example : { n : ℕ | n % 2 = 0 } = { n | 2 ∣ n } := by
  ext n
  simp only [Set.mem_setOf_eq]
  constructor <;> intro h <;> omega
```

# From a set back to a type: subtypes and coercion
%%%
tag := "foundations-sets-subtypes"
%%%

A set is not a type -- but sometimes you need one, for instance to
speak of a function defined only on `s`, or to sum over its elements. A
set can be *promoted* to a type by coercion: `↥s` denotes the subtype
`{ x // x ∈ s }` of its members, a genuinely new type whose terms pair
an element of `α` with a proof of membership.

```lean
-- coercing a set to a type gives the subtype of members
#check (↥Evens)                              -- a Type
example : ↥Evens = { x : ℕ // x ∈ Evens } :=
  rfl

-- an element of the subtype pairs a value with a proof
example : ↥Evens :=
  ⟨4, by show 4 % 2 = 0; decide⟩
```

With sets, subtypes, and their relationship to types in hand, we are
ready to look at the structures Mathlib builds on top of them.
