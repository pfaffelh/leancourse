This is\nuseful in particular when writing many definitions that have parameters in common (see below for an\nexample).\n\nVariable declarations have the same flexibility as regular function parameters. In particular they\ncan be [explicit, implicit][binder docs], or [instance implicit][tpil classes] (in which case they\ncan be anonymous). This can be changed, for instance one can turn explicit variable `x` into an\nimplicit one with `variable {x}`. Note that currently, you should avoid changing how variables are\nbound and declare new variables at the same time; see [issue 2789] for more on this topic.\n\nIn *theorem bodies* (i.e. proofs), variables are not included based on usage in order to ensure that\nchanges to the proof cannot change the statement of the overall theorem.
